## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

When we make design decisions during brainstorming or implementation:
- Document them as Architecture Decision Records in `docs/adr/`
- Use format: `NNN-title-in-kebab-case.md` (e.g., `001-use-typescript.md`)
- Include: Context, Decision, Consequences
- Keep ADRs concise and focused on a single decision
- Create the `docs/adr/` directory if it doesn't exist

## Discussion vs Implementation
When we're discussing the solution, don't start implementing before I tell you.
